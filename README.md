# matrix-factorize-dimsum
Matrix Factorization in Distributed Settings

## Dependencies

The code has been written using Python 3.6 and following dependencies:
- pyspark: 3.0.0
- findspark: 1.4.2
- scipy: 1.5.1
- numpy: 1.19.0

## Instructions
The main code is in `pyspark-main.ipynb` 
- Execution of the code should be carried out sequentially as there is severe cross-referencing
- The notebooks contains helpful comments wherever required

## Generating Dataset
Clone the repository in a place which doesn't require permissions to write data. The code in the notebook starts with generating some directories and then place the required dataset files inside them.
